# **Superstore_Portfolio_project**

## **Introduction**
### The following project is a case study of a superstore that includes studying the relationship between sales and profits in detail to derive insights from this relationship and provide advice that helps in the development of the work of this store. 
### In addition to studying the products that cause profit or loss for this store to submit proposals to the management regarding them. 


## **Some of the business questions to answer will be:**
### What is the relationship between sales and profits?
### Is it the rebate policy that brings profits to the company or vice versa?
### Is there an increase in the profits of the store over time or vice versa?
### Which customers bring the most profits to the store and what sets them apart from others?
### Which products bring the highest profits to the store and what causes loss?


## **Data Source:**
### The dataset to be used is from: **Data Visualization with Tableau Certificate.**
### performance Data Quality & Timeliness:

###
### We are going to build "our_table" form our raw data:
we will delete the rows for the ship_date field values (2015) because there is a data only for the first 6 days in 2015,
and the columns that we are going to use are (category - city - customer_name - region - segment - ship_date - ship-mode - state -
sub_category - discount - profit - profit_ratio - sales)
